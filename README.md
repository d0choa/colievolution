Colievolution
=============

Visual interface for the *E.coli* Protein Co-evolution Map published by Ochoa *et al*. in Bioinformatics (2015). The network is produced by combining the novel *p-mirrortree* method with the previously published *ContextMirror* ([Juan *et al*. PNAS 2008](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/3/934.abstract)). As a result, a comprehensive list of high-confident co-evolving proteins is produced independently of the starting genomic information.
